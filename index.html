Hi, I am Nihaar - welcome to my page. I am interested in both theoretical AI (probability, statistics, algorithms) and its various applications in industry!
Look around for some of my projects below. I recently graduated from Columbia University and previously from Oxford University.

I am always happy to chat with anyone for collaborations or just like that (please email me).

I am also on the job market for machine learning software/research
roles.
